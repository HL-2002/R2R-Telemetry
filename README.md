While the data to be inputted needs to be integrated within the system (so it is actually transmitted to the software and therefore, logged), as a MVP weâ€™ll be focusing exclusively on the software side of things with test data, so that the software is developed before the whole system is implemented.

### Running the program

Just make sure to run:

```
python main.py
```

Other files may be executed, although for testing purposes only.
